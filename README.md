# PDFTOPREZI

When digitizing images, many people simply scan them, resulting in PDFs with A4-sized backgrounds, even if the images are much smaller. This script processes a folder of such scans, crops the images with high DPI to maintain resolution, and saves them into a presentation. It's a highly specific tool, but I found it useful when I created it.

### Description
This Python script converts a folder of PDF scans into a properly cropped presentation format.

### Usage Notes
This script is designed to run on Python's IDLE, as indicated by the import statements at the beginning. Unless you fully understand the code and its comments, I **strongly recommend against running it**. I am not responsible for any consequences of using this code.
